# Simple Webpage 

This project is a basic HTML webpage for a restaurant. It includes a header section with navigation links and an "Order" button, a main content section with a text description, and a "Read Our Menu" button, and a footer section with a scroll image. Below is a README to help you understand the structure of this simple webpage:

## HTML Structure (index.html)

The HTML structure is divided into three main sections: Header, Main Content, and Footer. Here's a breakdown of the sections and their content:

### Header Section
- **Navigation**: A navigation bar with the restaurant's logo, menu links, and a "Contact" link.
- **Order Button**: A button labeled "Order" for placing an order.

### Main Content Section
- **Text**: A text paragraph with a description of the restaurant.

- **Menu Button**: A button labeled "Read Our Menu" for accessing the restaurant's menu.

### Footer Section
- **Scroll Image**: An image that may be indicative of scrolling or can be used for decorative purposes.

## CSS Styles (style.css)

You've referenced an external stylesheet named "style.css" to style the elements of your webpage. The specific styles, colors, and positioning of elements are defined in this stylesheet.

## Usage

This HTML webpage can be used as a starting point for creating a simple restaurant website. You can customize the content, add links, images, and further styling to make it fit your restaurant's branding and needs.

## Example

Here's an example of how you can use this project by including it in your HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Include necessary meta tags and link to the stylesheet -->
    <title>Your Restaurant</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Include the provided HTML structure here -->
    <!-- The structure can be customized and extended according to your restaurant's needs -->
</body>
</html>
```

Customize the content, replace images, and modify the links to fit your restaurant's information and branding.
